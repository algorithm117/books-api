# Books REST API

Contains over 10,000 book records with information about author(s), average rating, isbn information, language code, number of pages, and more.
Users of this API can perform CRUD operations on the database.

## Motivation

To build an application centered on the MERN stack. Allowed me to solidify my knowledge of Express.js and Node.js concepts while also teaching me that authentication is a topic I need to spend more time learning about.
Learned how important documentation is regarding the use of an API, and how 
important it is to make the API easy to use. Drawing diagrams to get a 
high-level overview of the project was an important part of this project and is something 
I would like to focus on more in the future by giving finer detail to my digrams.
